### 📅 Daily Questions
##### 🌜 Last night, after work, I...
- Did absolutely nothing, worked a little on the compilers shit, got gaslit by trevor about him going away for 2 weeks so ig I'm supposed to feel bad about that, had him complain about how it is the "most annoying thing" to book plans for a trip, talked a little with mike and played like 2 clash games

##### 🙌 One thing I'm excited about right now is...
- Idk anymore, just improving and hoping for a better life with friends that are closer and more loyal and better people that have actually been through things

##### 🚀 One+ thing I plan to accomplish today is...
- [x] Learn about Mamba
- [ ] Overview grammar for my language and make sure all bases are covered
- [x] Workout

##### 👎 One thing I'm struggling with today is...
- Care about the life around me, im starting to feel like everyone I surround myself with doesn't care about having good friends but just people to get them to the next step. Trevor is seeming less appealing as a friend bc I dont feel like he has been through a lot and seems very disconnected from a challenging life, very pretentious and the closer I get the more I think he is very stuck up and just hides it to feel better about himself but it shows itself nonetheless
